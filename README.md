# kali-brightness
A Python script that does what your $2,000 laptop drivers failed to do: dim the screen.  Features:      Stops your screen from flickering like a horror movie.      Two sliders: One for brightness, one for making your screen look like old paper (Night Mode).      Works on VMs, because VirtualBox drivers are imaginary.
